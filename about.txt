◦ Utilized spatio-temporal precipitation and temperature data from Northeast India to generate actionable climate
insights, which could aid in the formulation of evidence-based environmental strategies and policies.
◦ Applied clustering algorithms, including K-Means and DBSCAN, to climate data for comprehensive analysis.
◦ Ongoing development of Geographic information system visualizations, including cluster maps, heatmaps, and
time-series plots, using Python libraries and QGIS to illustrate spatio-temporal climate patterns..
